/*
Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.
Table: Customers.
+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+

Table: Orders.
+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+

Using the above tables as example, return the following:
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
 */

select A.Name as Customers from Customers as A
left join Orders as B
on A.Id = B.CustomerId
where B.CustomerId is null;
